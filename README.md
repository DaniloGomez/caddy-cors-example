# Caddy CORS

Use a `caddy` docker container to proxify an API and configure CORS.

## Note

Personally, I defend the idea of solving this problem only once, on the web server.
The use of CORS extensions in web frameworks are only temporary solutions for development.
Why not always use docker, even in development?
